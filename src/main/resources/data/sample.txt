The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower located in Paris, France. It was named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower. Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, it is 330 meters tall, making it one of the most iconic structures in the world. Originally criticized for its design, the Eiffel Tower has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most-visited monuments in the world, attracting nearly 7 million visitors annually.

In addition to its role as a tourist attraction, the Eiffel Tower serves as a broadcasting tower for radio and television. It has undergone several renovations to maintain its structure and improve its functionality. Today, it is not only a symbol of engineering excellence but also a testament to the innovation of the 19th century.
